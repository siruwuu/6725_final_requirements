# End-of-Semester Project Deliverables

## Overview

The end-of-semester project is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of applied AI by building a fully functional AI agent system. This is not a toy demo or proof-of-concept. You are building production-quality software that solves a real problem.

All projects must implement AI agents unless an alternative approach is explicitly approved by the professor. The deliverables mirror what you would produce in industry or academia: a working system, a conference-quality paper, a poster presentation, and a live demonstration.

We encourage you to treat this work as preparation for an upcoming AI conference. Past student projects have been presented at industry meetups, internal company showcases, and academic workshops. Aim high.

## Project Deliverables

Your final submission must include all of the following:

### 1. Project Paper

A conference-style paper (8-12 pages, excluding references) structured as follows:

**Title and Abstract**
- A concise title that reflects the project's focus
- A 250-300 word abstract summarizing the problem, approach, key techniques, and findings

**Introduction**
- The problem being addressed and why it matters
- Motivation and relevance to applied AI
- Research questions or hypotheses driving the work

**Related Work**
- Survey of existing solutions, tools, and research
- How your approach differs or improves upon prior work

**System Architecture**
- High-level architecture of your AI agent system
- Agent types and their responsibilities
- How agents coordinate, communicate, and share state
- External tools, APIs, and services integrated

**Data and Evaluation**
- Data sources used for development and validation
- Preprocessing, cleaning, and preparation steps
- Evaluation metrics and benchmarks
- Quantitative results with appropriate statistical rigor

**Models and Technologies**
- LLMs, embedding models, and other AI components used
- Frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Claude Agent SDK, etc.)
- Infrastructure and deployment considerations
- Justification for technical choices

**Responsible AI Considerations**
- Bias and fairness analysis
- Measures to reduce hallucinations and ensure factual accuracy
- Privacy considerations (PII handling, data anonymization)
- Safety measures and ethical implications

**Findings and Discussion**
- Key insights from building and evaluating the system
- Unexpected challenges and how they were addressed
- Performance trade-offs and scalability considerations

**Conclusion and Future Work**
- Summary of contributions
- Limitations of the current implementation
- Concrete directions for future improvement

**References**
- Academic papers, documentation, and resources cited

### 2. Code Repository

A well-organized GitHub repository containing:
- All source code with clear structure
- README with setup instructions and usage examples
- Requirements/dependencies properly specified
- Configuration files and environment setup
- Tests demonstrating core functionality
- Documentation for key components

Code quality matters. This repository represents your engineering capabilities to future employers and collaborators.

### 3. Demo

A working demonstration of your system:
- Live demo preferred; video acceptable if live demo is impractical
- 5-7 minutes showcasing core functionality
- Clear explanation of what the system does and how it works
- Demonstration of agent behavior and decision-making

### 4. Presentation Slides

A slide deck for your final presentation:
- 15-20 slides covering problem, approach, architecture, results, and demo
- Clear visualizations of system architecture and agent interactions
- Key metrics and evaluation results
- Professional quality suitable for a conference presentation

### 5. Poster

A conference-style poster (standard 48" x 36" format):
- Visual summary of your project
- Problem statement, approach, architecture diagram, key results
- QR code linking to your demo or repository
- Designed for a 3-minute verbal walkthrough

## Submission Requirements

**Format:**
- Paper: PDF, conference format (we recommend using LaTeX with a standard conference template or Quarto)
- Code: GitHub repository with this course's organization
- Slides: PDF or Google Slides link
- Poster: PDF (48" x 36")

## Conference Submission

We strongly encourage you to submit your work to an appropriate venue after the semester ends. Your paper and poster are designed to be conference-ready with minor revisions.

Potential venues to consider:
- [ODSC (Open Data Science Conference)](https://odsc.com/) - East (Boston) and West (San Francisco), accepts talks and posters on applied work
- [2026 Applied Machine Learning Conference](https://appliedml.us/2026/) - Focused on practical ML implementations

The professor and TAs can provide guidance on appropriate venues and submission timelines.
